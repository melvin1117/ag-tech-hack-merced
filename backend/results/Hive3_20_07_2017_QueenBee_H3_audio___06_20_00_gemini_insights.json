  "insights": [
    "The extremely high percentage of bee sounds (97.0%) indicates a thriving, healthy colony with minimal external disturbances.",
    "The long continuous sequence of bee sounds (105 segments) suggests consistent colony activity without interruptions, a sign of a well-established, undisturbed hive.",
    "The high confidence in sound classifications (88.9%) suggests regular, rhythmic buzzing patterns typical of a healthy colony engaged in normal activities."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Perform a visual inspection of the hive to confirm the audio analysis findings, checking for queen activity, brood patterns, and overall colony strength.",
    "Given the excellent audio profile, continue current management practices and consider expanding the colony or adding honey supers if in active season.",
    "Document the current hive conditions for baseline comparison in future monitoring, noting the strong acoustic indicators of colony health."
